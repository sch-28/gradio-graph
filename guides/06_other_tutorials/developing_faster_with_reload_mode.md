# Developing Faster with Auto-Reloading

**Prerequisite**: This Guide requires you to know about Blocks. Make sure to [read the Guide to Blocks first](/introduction_to_blocks).

## Why Auto-Reloading?

When you are building a Gradio demo, particularly out of Blocks, you may find it cumbersome to keep re-running your code to test your changes. 

To make it faster and more convenient to write your code, we've made it easier to "reload" your Gradio apps instantly when you are developing in a **Python IDE** (like VS Code, Sublime Text, PyCharm, or so on) or generally running your Python code from the terminal. We've also developed an analogous "magic command" that allows you to re-run cells faster if you use **Jupyter Notebooks** (or any similar environment like Colab).

This short Guide will cover both of these methods, so no matter how you write Python, you'll leave knowing how to build Gradio apps faster.

## Python IDE Reload üî•

If you are building Gradio Blocks using a Python IDE, your file of code (let's name it `app.py`) might looks something like this: 

```python
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# Greetings from Gradio!")
    inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
    out = gr.Textbox()

    inp.change(fn=lambda x: f"Welcome, {x}!", 
               inputs=inp, 
               outputs=out)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch()    
```

The problem is that anytime that you want to make a change to your layout, events, or components, you have to close and  rerun your app by writing `python app.py`.

Instead of doing this, you can run your code in **reload mode** by changing 1 word: `python` to `gradio`:

In the terminal, run `gradio app.py`. That's it! 

Now, you'll see that after you'll see something like this:

```bash
Launching in *reload mode* on: http://127.0.0.1:7860 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

Watching...

WARNING:  The --reload flag should not be used in production on Windows.
```

The important part here is the line that says `Watching...` What's happening here is that Gradio will be observing the directory where `app.py` file lives, and if the file changes, it will automatically rerun the file for you. So you can focus on writing your code, and your Gradio demo will refresh automatically ü•≥

‚ö†Ô∏è Now, there is one important thing to keep in mind when use the reload mode: Gradio specifically looks for a Gradio Blocks/Interface demo called `demo` in your code. If you have named your demo something else, you can pass that as the 2nd parameter in your code, like this: `gradio app.py my_demo`

As a small aside, this auto-reloading happens if you change your `app.py` source code or the Gradio source code. Meaning that this can be useful if you decide to [contribute to Gradio itself](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) ‚úÖ

## Jupyter Notebook Magic üîÆ

What about if you use Jupyter Notebooks (or Colab Notebooks, etc.) to develop code? We got something for you too!

We've developed a **magic command** that will create and run a Blocks demo for you. To use this, load the gradio extension at the top of your notebook: 

`%load_ext gradio`

Then, in the cell that you are developing your Gradio demo, simply write the magic command **`%%blocks`** at the top, and then write the layout and components like you would normally:

```py
%%blocks 

import gradio as gr

gr.Markdown("# Greetings from Gradio!")
inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder="What is your name?")
out = gr.Textbox()

inp.change(fn=lambda x: f"Welcome, {x}!", 
           inputs=inp, 
           outputs=out)
```

Notice that:

* You do not need to put the boiler plate `with gr.Blocks() as demo:` and `demo.launch()` code ‚Äî Gradio does that for you automatically!

* Every time you rerun the cell, Gradio will re-launch your app on the same port and using the same underlying web server. This means you'll see your changes *much, much faster* than if you were rerunning the cell normally. 

Here's what it looks like in a jupyter notebook:

ü™Ñ This works in colab notebooks too! [Here's a colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jUlX1w7JqckRHVE-nbDyMPyZ7fYD8488?authuser=1#scrollTo=zxHYjbCTTz_5) where you can see the Blocks magic in action. Try making some changes and re-running the cell with the Gradio code! 

The Notebook Magic is now the author's preferred way of building Gradio demos. Regardless of how you write Python code, we hope either of these methods will give you a much better development experience using Gradio.
